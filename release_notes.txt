Asha UI Component Demos
=======================

This Java ME application is a MIDlet suite consisting of demos that show how to
use LCDUI components in Nokia Asha applications. The examples have been
carefully built to accommodate to the device in use and they work in full touch, 
touch and type, and non-touch devices. The various examples are implemented as
independent MIDlets.
 
The MIDlet suite contains examples of the following components:

- Lists, demonstrating various List types. In some lists custom implementation 
  is used to provide improved support for softkeys and Action button 1.
- Text, demonstrating TextField.
- Dialogs, demonstrating different kinds of Alerts.
- Canvas, demonstrating different ways of presenting the Canvas.
- Form, demonstrating different Form items, including CustomItem components.
- Categories, demonstrating the CategoryBar with different amounts of 
  categories. In touch and type and non-touch devices, an additional view 
  has been implemented to show categories instead of the category bar.
- Ticker, demonstrating the Ticker item in Displayables.
- Confirmation, demonstrating the confirmation process.
- Empty content, demonstrating the ways to handle situations when a view 
  does not have any real content yet.
- Multiple items, demonstrating multiselection for positive selection or for
  deletion of items.
- Zoom, demonstrating different ways of zooming images.
- Add new, demonstrating how to generate and display new Form Items on the 
  fly.
- Interdependent, demonstrating how a Form can dynamically adjust itself 
  based on user input.
- Keypads, demonstrating different keypad layouts available for different text
  input needs.
- Menus, demonstrating how to use context menus and action #2 menu items.

This example application demonstrates:
- Different UI components and patterns that can be used in Nokia Asha phones.
- How to accommodate different input methods in an application.
