        // FORMS
        "Forms are the most versatile screen environment. "
        + "They are usually used for data input tasks. Therefore "
        + "they offer a wide variety of types of items and "
        + "ready-made choice groups. There should always be a Command available "
        + "for saving the changes. Cancelling should be done via the hardware back key."

        + "\n\n- Progress bar and slider "
        + "\n\nThese elements originate from the Gauge element. They can be  "
        + "\n- determinate progress indicators, used as filling horizontal bars; "
        + "these should be used if the process duration is predictable or if it "
        + "takes longer than 10 seconds"
        + "\n- indeterminate progress indicators, used as spinners; these should "
        + "only be used if the process length is not predictable but definitely less than 10 seconds."
        + "\n- sliders, used to set a value within a number range. The numbers are integers."

        + "\n\n- Exclusive pop-up group"
        + "\n\nTapping on the item opens a pop-up list. If there are more than 4 items in "
        + "the pop-up group, the group\'s content becomes scrollable. Once an item is selected, "
        + "the pop-up closes."

        + "\n- please note that no other tumbler content is possible"

        + "\n\n- Text input"
        + "\n\nIt is recommended that you do not \"preload\" the text field. The text field "
        + "header should contain all the relevant information for the text input field. "
        + "Please take care to use the right keyboard layout when opening the text input "
        + "field and when continuing with the text input."

        + "\n\n- Exclusive choice group (select)"
        + "\n\nThis is a set of items with an optional header and optional thumbnails. "
        + "Exactly one item must always be selected; the selected item is indicated with a highlight. "

        + "\n\nThis is a set of items with an optional header and optional thumbnails. "
        + "It is possible to select no items, one item or multiple items. Selected items "
        + "are indicated with a highlight."

        + "\n\n- Text string "
        + "\n\nThis offers the possibility to either "
        + "\n- display text, or "
        + "\n- create buttons and hyperlinks."
        + "\n\nIt is possible to give a label to each text string."

        + "\n\n- Image"
        + "\n\nThe image item allows images to be added into a form, e.g. to make the content "
        + "look more appealing, or to associate images with data input tasks."

        + "\n\n- Spacer"
        + "\n\nThis element allows components to be stretched."

        + "\n\n- Custom"
        + "\n\nIt is possible to create your own elements in a form screen and therefore "
        + "add custom elements in a feasible way to an existing palette of form items and groups. "
        + "The Custom item demonstrates 2 different examples:"
        + "\n\n1. Slider which allows, e.g. a start value different than 0 (1 in case of the example) "
        + "or which allows different numerical systems than the decimal numeral system â€“ "
        + "for example HH:MM:SS to build a seek bar for a media player."
        + "\n\n2. Switch which allows users to toggle between on/off states "
        + "(or other clearly opposite states). "

        + "\n\nFor more information on forms, please see the Nokia Asha design guidelines.",

        
        // CATEGORY BAR
        "Category bar supports two modes:"
        + "\n\n- Tab mode; used for parallel view navigation. Currently "
        + "active tab is highlighted."
        + "\n\n- Toolbar mode; used for presenting frequently used, important "
        + "actions. The maximum number of items in the Category bar is four. "
        + "\n\nFor more information on the category bar, please see the Nokia "
        + "Asha design guidelines.",
        
        // TICKER
        "This application shows how the ticker appears in different display types,"

        + "\n- canvases"
        + "\n- text boxes"
        + "\n- form"
        + "\n\nThe ticker appears as part of the chrome, and does not scroll away with the content."
        + "\n\nFor more information on tickers, please see the Nokia Asha design guidelines.",
        
        // CONFIRMATION
        "Confirmation patterns are necessary, especially if the user might "
        + "lose data by accident. In the Series 40 UI interaction style, "
        + "this can happen with use of the back button. The set action for "
        + "the back button is â€œcancel and discardï¿½? all changes. This may "
        + "cause difficulties, especially for people who are new to the "
        + "platform. To ensure that they do not discard previously made "
        + "changes, it is necessary to have a query following the back "
        + "command. The query must have at least 2 choices: YES/NO. In "
        + "addition, it is possible to add a help option to the query. "
        + "Please also check the other dialog layouts that are possible. "
        + "\n\nOn the other hand, there is no need for an additional "
        + "confirmation query if the user accepts changes that were made "
        + "in a form, via the tick mark in action button #1."
        + "\n\nFor more information on confirmation patterns, please see "
        + "the Series 40 full touch style guide.",
        
        // NO CONTENT
        "It is important to indicate to people if there is no content. "
        + "This will prevent people from perceiving your application as "
        + "broken or unresponsive. It may also help the out-of-box "
        + "experience of your application if people either have sample "
        + "content or a very obvious explanation of how to add their first "
        + "content."
        + "\n\nThis mini app shows 3 different variations:"
        + "\n\n- an indication of \'no content\' but no further action"
        + "\n\n- an add button in the content area, which disappears "
        + "after the first content is added"
        + "\n\n- an add button as action button #1, and a textual hint "
        + "informing the user that they should use this button to create "
        + "their first content"
        + "\n\nFor more information on empty content, please see the "
        + "Series 40 full touch style guide.",
        
        // MULTIPLE ITEMS
        "The multiple items patterns show how to handle the selection of multiple "
        + "items in case there is:" 
        + "\n\n- a positive selection, like adding multiple images to an e-mail,"
        + "\n\n- a negative selection, like deleting multiple items permanently from the "
        + "phone."

        + "\n\nIn a positive selection, the indicator for selecting an item is a white "
        + "checkmark on top of a green squircle. Action button 1 is filled with a "
        + "checkmark. The checkmark is greyed out in case no selection has been made. "
        + "Pressing the active checkmark in action button 1 does not evoke any "
        + "additional confirmation query, since the selection does not cause any "
        + "final loss. The user can undo the step easily, just by removing the "
        + "files from the list of attached files."

        + "\n\nThe negative selection, in contrast, could display a designated icon in "
        + "action button 1 showing the action being performed â€“ for example a trash "
        + "bin icon in case of deleting the items. The item marker could be a white "
        + "cross on a red squircle. This clearly indicates that this item will be "
        + "deleted when the action button 1 is tapped. Both metaphors imply a negative "
        + "connotation. When deleting an item permanently, the application should show "
        + "a confirmation query after action button 1 is pressed. This prevents the "
        + "user from losing important items just because of a badly performed gesture. "
        + "Action button 1 is dimmed as long as there is no selection made, i.e. "
        + "no item is marked."
        + "\nHowever, both patterns require a confirmation query in case the user "
        + "presses back. The query is always positively formulated, i.e. do you want "
        + "to perform this action? NO â€“ YES â€“ BACK.",

        
        // ZOOMING
        "Zooming can be done in various ways. This mini app demonstrates "
        + "three common ways:"
        + "\n\n- pinch zoom, for zooming in and zooming out"
        + "\n\n- slider zoom, where a separate slider component is used"
        + "\n\n- tap zoom â€“ double tapping toggles between maximum (2) "
        + "zoom factor and normal (1) zoom factor"
        + "\n\nThe image can be panned in any of the cases."
        + "\n\nFor more information on zoom, please see the Series 40 "
        + "full touch style guide.",
        
        // ADD NEW
        "This pattern demonstrates how to add new items to a form. The button "
        + "at the bottom of the form adds a new item. It is not possible to dim "
        + "an item and make it become active later. The entire form is saved by "
        + "pressing the checkmark in action button 1, or via back button and "
        + "the related confirmation query. The query is always positively "
        + "formulated, i.e. do you want to perform this action? NO â€“ YES â€“ BACK.",
        
        // INTERDEPENDENT
        "This pattern shows how to overcome the fact that it is not "
        + "possible to dim items. The example demonstrates three "
        + "interdependent popup choicegroups. The selection of the "
        + "choicegroup defines the content of the next choicegroup. "
        + "Popup choicegroup is well suited for this task, since it "
        + "does not change too much of the visible content in case there "
        + "is a change in a previous item. Besides, the closed choicegroup "
        + "allows the user to glance the entire selection."
        + "The Done button is only shown in case the user has made a "
        + "selection from the last popup choicegroup. The StringItem "
        + "button is more visible than the icon in action button one (in "
        + "case the StringItem is always shown above the fold) and might "
        + "ease the selection task. "

        + "\n\nA real-life task could be the selection of town:"
        + "\n- Continent"
        + "\n- Country"
        + "\n- (Optional state)"
        + "\n- Town"

        + "\n\nThis would avoid any virtual keyboard use and might be an "
        + "alternative to a text-input based search.",
        
        // KEYPADS
        "This application demonstrates the different keypad layouts available "
        + "in Series 40. There are:"

        + "\n\n- Item specific menu, containing only commands which act on a "
        + "particular item. "
        + "\n\nOptions menu is accessed via the options menu icon, whereas the "
        + "item specific menu is opened via a long press on the particular "
        + "item. "
        + "\n\nIn non-touch phones, these 2 menus are merged into the options "
        + "menu. This is possible due to the focus. The Options menu may "

        + "only on the item which has the focus."
        + "\n\nIn case the options menu is empty, the icon is dimmed in full "
