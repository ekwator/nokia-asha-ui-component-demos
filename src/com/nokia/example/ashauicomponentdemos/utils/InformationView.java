        + "\n\n- Progress bar and slider "

        + "\n- determinate progress indicators, used as filling horizontal bars; "

        + "takes longer than 10 seconds"

        + "only be used if the process length is not predictable but definitely less than 10 seconds."
        + "\n- sliders, used to set a value within a number range. The numbers are integers."

        + "\n\n- Exclusive pop-up group"

        + "\n\n- Text input"
        + "\n\nIt is recommended that you do not \"preload\" the text field. The text field "

        + "\n- display text, or "
        + "\n- create buttons and hyperlinks."
        + "\n\nIt is possible to give a label to each text string."

        + "\n\n- Image"
        + "\n\nThe image item allows images to be added into a form, e.g. to make the content "
        + "look more appealing, or to associate images with data input tasks."

        + "\n\n- Spacer"
        + "\n\nThis element allows components to be stretched."

        + "\n\n- Custom"
        + "\n\nIt is possible to create your own elements in a form screen and therefore "
        + "add custom elements in a feasible way to an existing palette of form items and groups. "
        + "The Custom item demonstrates 2 different examples:"
        + "\n\n1. Slider which allows, e.g. a start value different than 0 (1 in case of the example) "
        + "or which allows different numerical systems than the decimal numeral system â€“ "
        + "for example HH:MM:SS to build a seek bar for a media player."
        + "\n\n2. Switch which allows users to toggle between on/off states "
        + "(or other clearly opposite states). "

        + "\n\nFor more information on forms, please see the Nokia Asha design guidelines.",

        + "active tab is highlighted."

        + "actions. The maximum number of items in the Category bar is four. "

        + "\n\n- By creating and showing a PopupList component. This is useful "
        + "when you need to explicitly control when to show/hide the menu. "
        + "You can use PopupList e.g. for showing context menu for a selection on a "
        + "Canvas."
